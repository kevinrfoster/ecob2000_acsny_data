### A different dataset...
  
Now we will pivot and use a different dataset, ACS data on wage, education (and lots of other things). You can get this data from the [course page](https://kfoster.ccny.cuny.edu/classes/fall2022/).

We will work on an extract with only people who live in the state of New York. It includes quite granular geographic information, getting down to a person's neighborhood (referred to as PUMA). Well, that's not quite true. In NYC PUMA means a relatively small area although in upstate, where the population density is so much lower, a PUMA could be quite large in order to collect together enough people. In NYC, PUMA is a neighborhood.

The PUMA codes are cryptic. You have to go to the codebook (or, in this case, the file PUMA_levels.csv or acs2017_codebook.txt from the zip file) to find out that 3801 codes for Washington Heights/Inwood, 3802 is Hamilton Heights/Manhattanville/West Harlem, etc. The program will happily calculate the average value for PUMA (type in *mean(PUMA)* and see for yourself!) but this is a meaningless value -- wtf is the average neighborhood code value!? A PUMA value here is like a zip code, it's a number but you wouldn't want to do number-type operations such as taking a mean. (Although R would let you do that.)

If you want to select just people living in a particular neighborhood then you'd have to look at the list below.

So you want to tell R to treat PUMA as a factor.
```{r}
load("acs2017_ny_data.RData")
attach(acs2017_ny)
PUMA <- as.factor(PUMA)
```
And you might want to do that for some of the others too.

I will leave you to worry over the recoding of the other variables, because it's good for the soul. I will show you 2 ways -- the quick and dirty way, and the fancy correct way.

First the quick and dirty way.
```{r}
female <- as.factor(female)
print(levels(female))
levels(female) <- c("male","female")
```
Well, ways,
```{r}
educ_indx <- factor((educ_nohs + 2*educ_hs + 3*educ_somecoll + 4*educ_college + 5*educ_advdeg), levels=c(1,2,3,4,5),labels = c("No HS","HS","SmColl","Bach","Adv"))
```

(If you can figure out how that bit of code works, that would be good)

These just type in the levels. But for things like PUMA, it could be a long list and might not even match every one. To do it better, we need help from an R package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plyr)
levels_n <- read.csv("PUMA_levels.csv")
levels_orig <- levels(PUMA) 
levels_new <- join(data.frame(levels_orig),data.frame(levels_n))
levels(PUMA) <- levels_new$New_Level
```

Those commands read in a little csv file that I had made, with the PUMA codes, then matches the old codes with the new complete text. Note that I'm lazy so codes in NY state outside of NYC are coded NA.

R will do the summary differently when it knows the variable is a factor,
```{r}
summary(PUMA)
summary(educ_indx)
```

To find mean and standard deviation by neighborhood, you could use something like this,

```{r}
ddply(acs2017_ny, .(PUMA), summarize, mean = round(mean(AGE), 2), sd = round(sd(AGE), 2), n_obsv = length(PUMA))
```
Although tapply would also work fine.

Here's the 90th and 10th percentiles of wages by neighborhood,

```{r}
dat_use1 <- subset(acs2017_ny,((INCWAGE > 0) & in_NYC))
ddply(dat_use1, .(PUMA), summarize, inc90 = quantile(INCWAGE,probs = 0.9), inc10 = quantile(INCWAGE,probs = 0.1), n_obs = length(INCWAGE))
```

You could also use table (or crosstabs) for factors with fewer items,

```{r}
table(educ_indx,female)
xtabs(~educ_indx + female)
```
Want proportions instead of counts?
```{r}
prop.table(table(educ_indx,female))
```

Try it and see what happens if you use table with PUMA...

This data includes not just whether a person has a college degree but also what field was the degree in: Economics or Psychology, for instance. Look over the codebook about DEGFIELD and DEGFIELDD (that second D means more detail) to see the codes. Maybe look at 10th and 90th percentiles by degree field?
  
```{r}
detach()
```
